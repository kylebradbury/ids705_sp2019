    "Here you'll bring together some of the individual skills that you demonstrated above and create a Jupyter notebook based blog post on data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a dataset that interests you and relates to a question or problem that you find intriguing\n",
    "2. Using a Jupyter notebook, describe the dataset, the source of the data, and the reason the dataset was of interest.\n",
    "3. Check the data and see if they need to be cleaned: are there missing values? Are there clearly erroneous values? Do two tables need to be merged together? Clean the data so it can be visualized.\n",
    "3. Plot the data, demonstrating interesting features that you discover. Are there any relationships between variables that were surprising or patterns that emerged? Please exercise creativity and curiosity in your plots.\n",
    "4. What insights are you able to take away from exploring the data? Is there a reason why analyzing the dataset you chose is particularly interesting or important? Summarize this as if your target audience was the readership of a major news organization - boil down your findings in a way that is accessible, but still accurate.\n",
    "5. Create a public repository on your github account titled \"machine-learning-course\". In it, create a readme file that contains the heading \"ECE590: Introductory Machine Learning for Data Science\". Add, commit, and push that Jupyter notebook to the master branch. Provide the link to the that post here."
